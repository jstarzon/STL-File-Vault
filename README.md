# STL File Vault

STL File Vault is a web application that provides a secure platform for users to upload and store STL (Standard Tessellation Language) files. It offers an intuitive interface for uploading files, collecting contact details, and securely storing them on the server.

As I continue my journey of learning React, I've created this application to streamline the process of 3D printing for my friends. With STL File Vault, they can easily upload their STL files and provide specific instructions, allowing me to bring their creations to life.

## Features

- Easy file upload: Drag and drop STL files onto the upload area or click to select files.
- File format validation: Only accepts STL files to ensure data integrity.
- Contact details collection: Capture user's contact details including name, email, and message.
- Secure storage: All uploaded files and contact details are securely stored on the server.
- User feedback: Receive confirmation messages upon successful file upload and contact details submission.

## Technologies Used

- Front-end: React.js, HTML, CSS
- Back-end: Node.js, Express.js
- Database: MongoDB (or any other database of your choice)
